What part of the code was most confusing and why?: I struggled to understand what was going on with the setInterval codeblock because I didn't realize where the 500 at the end had come from or how it was connected. It took me a while to figure out that it was the interval time (500ms). I also tend to forget that the modulo operator "%" represents the remainder, not division itself, and that took me a while to recall.

How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?: The animation changes at each step of the way, helping to illuminate the different things within the program that are changing throughout the process.

What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?: I made visual changes in order to get a bit more familiar with HTML. I made the text font larger and changed the background color to green. I could also see a use case for a countdown being implemented, counting down from 10 to 1, to more clearly represent the impending end state.
